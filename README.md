Was organizing group dinners also an unnecessarily painstaking experience for you too? Asking what day and what time everyone is available, what food they want and what restaurants they like; scrolling up and down the chat history to find everyone's answers to solve the complicated equation for the optimal date and place... I feel you! So I developed this app to help to make the process easier. :)

Organizing group dinners is now made easy! 

## Step by Step 

### Log in/Sign up

A quick sign up to create an account to better manage your invites! 


### User Dashboard

All the invites you create will be displayed on your home page dashboard. Hosting multiple group dinners at the same time? Let's help you orgnanize!


### Create A New Invite

Time to create the invite! 

Create your invitation by simply enter the title
```
Girls Night Out!
```
a brief description
```
Hey girls, miss you all! Let's get dinner next week! 
```
a date range within which the event is going to happen
```
4-20 to 4-27
```
Create a list of restaurants for your guests to choose from by searching for the specific restaurants you have in mind or simply a type of food.

The search results of the restaurants will be set to your zip code by default, but you can also easily change it.

Annnnnd you are done! Submit it and you will have a shareable invitation link to send to your friends!


### Respond To An Invite

You don't have to have an account to respond to the invites. (yay!)

The details of the result will show after confirming that you are attending.

Pick multiple days that you are available on.

Take a look at more information of the restaurants options by clicking on the i button.

Click on the restaurants to select your choices!

And comment (if you want to!) and submit!

That's it!
 
### Collect The Results

You can either see every individual response or check out the charts that help you understand which date/restaurants are most selected.

Optimal dates and restaurants? There you go!

You can send out the final invite on the website too!

Bon App√©tit :)
